# Details of this folder

Within each of the `*_app/` folders, there are a few things to note:

- `migrations/`: This folder and the file contents are automatically created by Django as part of tracking changes made to the "data model". More details are on the [Django Docs](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.2/topics/migrations/) site. Create them with `python manage.py makemigrations`.
